## This is the Code Book for the Course Project

### This code book outlines the variables recorded in the final data file, post-cleaning.

subject_ID - an identifier for each of the 30 subjects who carried out the activities listed below.
activity - the action that the subject undertook coded as follows:
		WALKING - walking
		WALKING_UPSTAIRS - walking upstairs
		WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS - walking downstairs
		SITTING - sitting down
		STANDING - standing up
		LAYING - lying/laying down

Each subject completed each activity and each row is the mean outcome for that subject and activity.
There are 30 subjects and 6 activities giving 180 observations.

### The descriptions of the observed measurements for each subject and activity are described below.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Mean Standard deviation
